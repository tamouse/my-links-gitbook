Jon Duckett's Book "HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites": [http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/)

Here's a CSS cheat sheet i lifted from somewhere: [https://github.com/tamouse/cheat-sheet-collection/blob/master/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://github.com/tamouse/cheat-sheet-collection/blob/master/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Knowing your way around the CSS docs at Mozilla Dev Network is useful, too: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

One of my fav sites, too is CSS-Tricks [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)

_ALSO_: an important site to view, learn, and play with CSS and HTML: [https://codepen.io](https://codepen.io) -- there are tons of examples and show pieces
