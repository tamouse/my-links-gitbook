[An Open Letter to White Liberals Blaming 'Low Information' Black Voters for Not Cleaning Up White Folks' Mess](https://www.theroot.com/an-open-letter-to-white-liberals-blaming-low-informatio-1842100419) from the estimable Michael Harriot. A letter \(originally a set of twitter tweets, but collected and edited here\) that dispell the myth of the uneducated Black voter, and put the blame for Bernie Sanders losses in the South square on the problem: White voters. The Black communities know, from vast erxperience, that they cannot trust White voters, and so vote for the candidate that will hopefully do the least harm. Right now, in 2020, that is Joe Biden.

They have published their [report](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy%20) on freedom in 2020: "A Leaderless Struggle for Democracy"
