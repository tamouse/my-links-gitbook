[An Open Letter to White Liberals Blaming 'Low Information' Black Voters for Not Cleaning Up White Folks' Mess](https://www.theroot.com/an-open-letter-to-white-liberals-blaming-low-informatio-1842100419) from the estimable Michael Harriot. A letter \(originally a set of twitter tweets, but collected and edited here\) that dispell the myth of the uneducated Black voter, and put the blame for Bernie Sanders losses in the South square on the problem: White voters. The Black communities know, from vast erxperience, that they cannot trust White voters, and so vote for the candidate that will hopefully do the least harm. Right now, in 2020, that is Joe Biden.

[Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org) is founded on the core conviction that freedom flourishes in democratic nations where governments are accountable to their people.

[The Powell Memo](http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/Powell%20Archives/PowellMemorandumTypescript.pdf) -- "Attack on American Free Enterprise System" by Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

[The Other Swing Voter](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/other-swing-voter/604474/) - No one’s paying much attention to one chunk of the electorate that could prove decisive in 2020.

* Spoiler: It's the people who swing between voting Democrat and not voting at all that matter the most, since it is concentrated in younger voters, black voters, and voters of colour. They don't see anything in the current rowboat of candidates that will improve their lives.
