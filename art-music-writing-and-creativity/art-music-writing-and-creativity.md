[A Hilariously Deadpan Web Series Featuring Single Shot Episodes Without Dialogue or Camera Moves](https://laughingsquid.com/the-mute-series/) -- I'm just going to cheat and quote Laughing Squid here, because I don't know how else to describe this:

> Filmmaker [Andy Lambert](http://www.andy-lambert.co.uk/) has created [_The Mute Series_](http://www.muteseries.com/), a hilarious independent web series with short, single-shot episodes that feature neither dialogue nor camera movement. Each of the episodes is about two minutes long with very subject-focused stories shot in deadpan film minimalism.
